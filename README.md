- 👋 Hi, I’m @gunthermaier. I am a professor at Modul Universiy in Vienna, Austria.
- 👀 I’m interested in open access publishing and the tools supporing that. One of those is Open Journals Sysem (OJS).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to write plugins for OJS. This implies learning PHP. I know a couple of other programming languages (Perl, Javascript) reasonably well, but PHP is new to me.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open access publishing, OJS, OJS plugins, PHP.
- 📫 How to reach me: gunther.maier at wu.ac.at
